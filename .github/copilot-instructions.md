# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Context Source of Truth**: The file `CLAUDE.md` in the root directory contains the absolute rules for this project regarding:
   - Architecture (Clean Architecture + Feature Slices)
   - Tech Stack (Next.js 16, Zustand, Tailwind v4)
   - Testing Requirements (MANDATORY unit tests)
   - Coding Standards

2. **Automatic Context**: You must assume the rules in `CLAUDE.md` apply to every request.

3. **Testing**: Never generate code without corresponding unit tests.

Please refer to `CLAUDE.md` for specific implementation details.
